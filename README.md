## NZWALKS API - Udemy Course Project
The "NZWALKS API" project is a part of a Udemy course focusing on building a RESTful API for managing walking tracks in New Zealand. The API provides endpoints to perform various operations related to walking tracks, such as retrieving track information, adding new tracks, updating existing tracks, and deleting tracks. It serves as a practical example of building a robust and scalable API using modern web development technologies.

## Overview
The project aims to provide a comprehensive API solution for managing walking tracks across New Zealand. It leverages the principles of RESTful architecture to design endpoints that allow clients to interact with track data efficiently. The API follows best practices in web development, including proper request handling, authentication, data validation, and error handling.

## Features
- Retrieve Track Information: Users can access detailed information about walking tracks, including track name, location, difficulty level, length, and description.
- Add New Tracks: Authorized users can add new walking tracks to the database by providing relevant information via API requests.
- Update Existing Tracks: Users can update existing track information, such as modifying track details or updating track conditions.
- Delete Tracks: Authorized users have the ability to delete tracks from the database, providing a way to manage track data dynamically.
- Error Handling: The API includes robust error handling mechanisms to provide informative error responses in case of invalid requests or server errors.

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core Web API: The project utilizes ASP.NET Core Web API framework for building the RESTful API endpoints.
- Entity Framework Core: Data persistence is achieved through Entity Framework Core, enabling seamless interaction with the database.
- Swagger: API documentation is generated using Swagger, providing a user-friendly interface for exploring available endpoints.
